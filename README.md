What is a Scratch Wallet?

A scratch wallet is a special type of disposable crypto wallet which contains an Unknown Private Key or UPK. The idea is that you don't need to transact the crypto on the wallet, you can transact the whole wallet. The scratch wallet is a non-KYC "disposable" wallet intended to be passed hand-to-hand for the possibility of cash-like physical transferral of crypto without an internet connection. The scratch wallet may have exposed public keys printed on to allow a user to deposit into but not withdraw from the scratch wallet, however this isn't necessicarily the case. Some producers of scratch wallets will use it to distribute their digital products in the physical world. 

For example, a company that produces trading cards may have an online game in which NFTs are used and they release a limited edition trading card that is also a scratch wallet. This allows the trading card company to "package" a unique NFT in a physical item. In this case let's imagine the company creates a physical and NFT version of the same card and makes an identical number of cards and NFTs. The company decides to print private keys under the face of the card and the face is printed on a peel off layer. In order for a collector of these trading cards to access the utility of the NFT in game, they have to choose to destroy the card in order to access the keys. This is a perfect example, because all the value of a scratch wallet resides in the security seal, in some cases it's a scratch surface, but this company decided to use a peel off surface which works the same as long as security features are used.

What is an Unknown Private Key?

A UPK is an interesting object, it's not quite a private key, its more like the promise of a private key. A company who produces scratch wallets becomes a trustee, this makes it very important that the producer act in good faith to become a trustworthy source of UPKs. As the developer of this technology I decided to make it open source in the interest of being as transparent as possible. I plan to reveal all my procedures to the public, so they can see the process, how it works and verify the products I am producing do in fact contain UPKs and can be called scratch wallets. 

In order to be classified as a UPK it must meet the following conditions:
Ensure private keys are unreadable until scratched
Ensure only 1 physical representation of the UPK exists
Never commit the seed phrase or private keys to memory, if commited to RAM or buffers clear memory once printed to destroy any traces of the sensitive data.
Contain a security seal that is forgery resistant. 
Come from a trusted source

Furthermore a scratch wallet adds additional layers of security on top of a UPK to give users the tools to detect a forgery. Some of these techniques include a unique serial number, unique CGI signatures derived from said serial numbers, creating a transaction from a trustee's wallet with the hash from the associated serial number as a sort of certificate of authenticity. Physical security techniques can additionally be used to ensure the card itself is not compromised such as micro-printing, raised printing, holographic seals, tamper evident seals, water marking and microchipping. Any reliable producer of scratch wallets will create an app to allow owners or potential recipients of the wallets to help easily identify forgeries.

For example the first scratch wallet project I am working on is a Crypto Cheque. This specific type of scratch wallet will be made by generating  the private keys and deriving the public keys and address. A unique serial number will be generated and hashed into a unique computer generate signature image. The serial number and a low resolution version of the signature image will be rendered to the card. The card gets printed, scratch area gets laminated to protect the keys and the scratch surface is applied. Finally on the scratch surface the high res signature image is applied along with a serial number, production date and blank date and signature field. Below is an example of a finished sheet of scratch wallets.

Upon inspecting the card a potential recipient should check the signature image on the scratch surface matches the low res signature image, they should not have the same resolution or its possible someone tried to copy or reproduce the image. They should check there is no damage or apparent tampering of the scratch area and ensure all the serial numbers on the card match. After a visual inspection the potential recipient should open a validator app, in this app the user would scan the public qr code and check tha balance of the scratch wallet. Once they confirm the amount is correct they can validate the card if the wallet was actually created by out company. The validator app will ask for the serial number and production date. If the the serial number and creation date entered don't match the expected value the app will return a message saying the SN and date don't match the expected value. This may indicate a forgery if it wasn't entered erroneously. If the SN and date match the expected values a set of 6 CGI signatures will pop up, if you don't see the image depicted in your scratch area on this page this indicates you have a forgery. If they see a match they will select it and the app will let them know that the note has passed all tests but to be extra vigilant as a good quality forgery could still pass all these tets. As such the most definitive test would be to scratch the UPK and use the scratch wallet companion app to try to move the crypto on the spot. If however the recipient is satisfied the UPK is uncompromised they can keep the card as a representation of the contents.

To expand on this scratch card idea we could also create digital scratching devices to generate UPKs which would be encrypted until the owner of this scratch wallet either scratches the UPK or transfers it to another compatible digital scratching device. As with before we are not moving crypto but the UPKs, giving only the scratcher control over the tokens in the wallet. These wallets could be transferred online across the internet or totally offline using NFC, bluetooth or other forms of wireless, wired or physical communication. Yes...transfer crypto offline and without creating a transaction on the blockchain.

To further expand on the physical scratch wallets there are a few more types I would like to discuss. The first is how this technology could be used to create Cryptographically Backed Physical Assets or CBPAs. The trading card example from earlier is an example of a CBPA. It is an asset with the value stored and accessible. This could be used to print legal tender or crypto cash. A bank note printer can hide private keys under a security film, the printer can pass a certain amount of USDC or a future CBDC to give the bank note the same value as the denomination indicated. If a person wanted to, they could peel off the security strip, which, in the process of peeling splits the bill rendering the bill valuless. The advantage would be that cash can be spent online or in person, the bill will be transacted hand to hand until it reaches someone who destroys the physical bill for the private keys.

Another use case of CBPAs is collectible figurines. Imagine a metal plaque with the keys engraved on it and encased in porcelain. In order to access the figurine the user would have to destroy the physical object, just like a piggybank. This decision, however is within control of the item and scratch wallet manufacturer. The figurine producer may decide they want the user to keep the physical item, they could just add a scratch are to the bottom. This way they have the best of both worlds, a digital token to use on the blockchain and a physical ghost of the value that left it's vessle behind. Now an unscratched figurine should theoretically have the combined value of the physical object and the NFT or crypto contained within.

As of right now the code is in it's infancy. It currently generates 10 bitcoin addresses, derives all the other information required including WIF, public keys, address, QR images, serial numbers and signature images. Using an HTML template it fills in the information and saves the public information to a file. The private sheet will be directly printed to a printer so the private keys are not saved to storage at any point.

The end game for the crypto cheque project is to create a secure closed loop printer where blank media goes in and fully secure scratch wallets come out, in a completely unobservable mannor. I will likely need to find the right printer or, more likely, I'll need to build or modify a printer that can either have it's memory controlled by an external device or contains no memory or buffer but can print from datastreams. The device will work and encouraged to be offline for enhanced security.
